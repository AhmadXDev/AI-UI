# AI-UI

This repository explores creating and testing various user interfaces using the React Native framework, with GitHub Copilot generating all the code. UI designs are first generated by an AI image tool, then provided to Copilot to produce the corresponding React Native UI code.

## Financial Dashboard (Issue #6)

This implementation recreates a financial dashboard UI from a provided screenshot using React Native and TypeScript.

### Features Implemented

- **Balance Display**: Large, prominent balance amount ($12,500)
- **Expenses Section**: 
  - Three expense categories (Groceries, Electronics, Pets) with amounts
  - Progress bars showing spending distribution
  - Page indicator dots
- **Weekly Activity Chart**: Bar chart showing daily activity with highlighted current day
- **Recent Transactions**: List of transactions with icons, descriptions, and amounts
- **Responsive Design**: Flex-based layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Proper accessibility labels and touch targets ≥ 44dp

```

### How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run on iOS:
   ```bash
   npm run ios
   ```

3. Run on Android:
   ```bash
   npm run android
   ```

4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

5. Run linter:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

### Demo Flow

1. App starts with a simple menu screen
2. Tap "View Dashboard" to navigate to the financial dashboard
3. Dashboard displays all sections as shown in the original screenshot

### Design Decisions

- **Color Scheme**: Uses iOS-style blue (#007AFF) for primary actions and progress bars
- **Typography**: iOS Human Interface Guidelines inspired font sizes and weights
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing scale using multiples of 4px
- **Components**: Modular design with reusable components for easy maintenance
- **Data**: All data is mocked for demo purposes - no network calls
- **Navigation**: Simple state-based navigation (can be easily replaced with React Navigation)

### Libraries Used

- **react-native-safe-area-context**: For proper safe area handling
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better development experience

No additional UI libraries were needed as the design was achievable with React Native's built-in components and styling.

### Accessibility

- All interactive elements have proper accessibility labels
- Touch targets meet minimum 44dp requirement
- Proper semantic markup for screen readers
- Good color contrast for text readability

### Future Enhancements

This UI-only implementation is ready for real business logic integration:

- Replace mock data with actual API calls
- Add real navigation with React Navigation
- Implement transaction filtering and sorting
- Add animation and gesture support
- Connect to actual financial data sources
