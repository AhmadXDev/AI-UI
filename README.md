# AI-UI

This repository explores creating and testing various user interfaces using the React Native framework, with GitHub Copilot generating all the code. UI designs are first generated by an AI image tool, then provided to Copilot to produce the corresponding React Native UI code.

This is a [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

## Prerequisites

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

For Android development, you'll need:
- Node.js (>= 16)
- Android Studio with Android SDK
- Android emulator or physical device
- Java Development Kit (JDK 17)

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

First, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

### Step 2: Start Metro

Run **Metro**, the JavaScript bundler for React Native:

```bash
npm start
# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 3: Run the App

#### For Android (Emulator)

Make sure you have an Android emulator running or a device connected, then:

```bash
npm run android
# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS (if on macOS)

First, install CocoaPods dependencies:

```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run ios
# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

## Development

### Modifying the App

1. Open `App.tsx` in your code editor
2. Make your changes
3. The app will automatically reload with your changes (Fast Refresh)

### Force Reload

- **Android**: Press `R` twice or use Ctrl+M (Cmd+M on macOS) to open the Dev Menu
- **iOS**: Press `R` in the iOS Simulator

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the [React Native Troubleshooting Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/troubleshooting)
2. Ensure your development environment is properly set up
3. Try cleaning and rebuilding:
   ```bash
   cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..
   npm start --reset-cache
   ```
